            <h3>Geothermal Valley</h3>
            <p>There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their
                own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa 
                geothermal valley in Rotorua.  Our traditional Maori 
                explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states 
                that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te 
                Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s core
                while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was
                stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking
                for their brother, they left part of the fire they
                carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating
                the geothermal activity that remains today.</p>

            <h3>Ahua Gallery</h3>
            <p>Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori 
                warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many
                different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs),
                pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), 
                tao (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs). The 
                long weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often 
                tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given names 
                and passed down through generations.</p>
                <p>Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away 
                    traditional Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces 
                    made at our National Carving School. Look for the Te Puia 
                    Official Mark of Authenticity. We also accept carving 
                    commissions.</p>
