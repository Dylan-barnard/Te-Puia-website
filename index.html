            <h2>Geothermal Valley</h2>
            <p>There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their
                own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa 
                geothermal valley in Rotorua.  Our traditional Maori 
                explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states 
                that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te 
                Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s core
                while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was
                stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking
                for their brother, they left part of the fire they
                carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating
                the geothermal activity that remains today.</p>
