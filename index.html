            <h2>Geothermal Valley</h2>
            <p>There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their
                own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa 
                geothermal valley in Rotorua.  Our traditional Maori 
                explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states 
                that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te 
                Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s core
                while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was
                stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking
                for their brother, they left part of the fire they
                carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating
                the geothermal activity that remains today.</p>

            <h2>Mud Pools</h2>
            <p>The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause 
                the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called 
                kaolin. 
                
                Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black 
                sulphur turns it to grey. The activity varies with the amount 
                of rainfall, but the temperature of the steaming bursts of mud 
                is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees 
                Fahrenheit). This mud pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” 
                because of the similarity between the plopping mud and leaping 
                frogs. 
                
                Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that 
                are used to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments. Māori 
                traditionally used the mud to treat stomach infections by 
                mixing a small amount with water and drinking it. 
                
                Mud pools are created in areas that have limited hot water, 
                but abundant supplies of steam and rock. That “pongy” smell 
                Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen sulphide released 
                by geothermal features. When released into the air, the 
                hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid.
                 This acid has the ability to dissolve rock into fine particles 
                 of silica and clay, and when combined with a small supply of 
                 water, a mud pool is created. The Rotorua Thermal Mud used 
                 in face masks and other beauty products is sourced from mud 
                 pools about ten times the size of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. 
                 You can purchase some of these products from Te Puia’s 
                 Gift Shop.</p>
