            <h2>Carvings</h2>
            <p>In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began 
                the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. 
                Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become 
                master carver of the institute today.</p> 
            <p>Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the 
                national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as 
                Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who 
                were once institute carving students themselves.</p>

            <h2>Weavings</h2>
            <p>At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills 
                and traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. “I believe 
                weaving can only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by 
                listening, by touching and by doing,” says head of the weaving 
                school, Edna Pahewa.</p>
            <p>As well as learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other 
                materials, students learn the stories and designs unique to 
                each iwi (tribe), as well as the Māori protocols associated 
                with weaving. These include planting according to the phases 
                of the moon and reciting prayers of thanks for flax and trees 
                used.</p>
