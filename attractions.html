            <h2>Mud Pools</h2>
            <p>The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause 
                the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called 
                kaolin. 
                
                Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black 
                sulphur turns it to grey. The activity varies with the amount 
                of rainfall, but the temperature of the steaming bursts of mud 
                is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees 
                Fahrenheit). This mud pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” 
                because of the similarity between the plopping mud and leaping 
                frogs. 
                
                Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that 
                are used to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments.</p> 
            <p>Māori traditionally used the mud to treat stomach infections
                 by mixing a small amount with water and drinking it. 
                
                Mud pools are created in areas that have limited hot water, 
                but abundant supplies of steam and rock. That “pongy” smell 
                Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen sulphide released 
                by geothermal features. When released into the air, the 
                hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid.
                 This acid has the ability to dissolve rock into fine particles 
                 of silica and clay, and when combined with a small supply of 
                 water, a mud pool is created. The Rotorua Thermal Mud used 
                 in face masks and other beauty products is sourced from mud 
                 pools about ten times the size of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. 
                 You can purchase some of these products from Te Puia’s 
                 Gift Shop.</p>

            <h2>Pohutu Geyser</h2>
            <p>Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and 
                erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, 
                as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. 
                According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the
                 gods. To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is 
                 the “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince 
                 Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally 
                 named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before 
                 and then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up 
                 to seven metres (almost 23 feet). The “Kererū” Geyser erupts 
                 every few days from the blackened crater closest to Puarenga 
                 Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up to 15 metres
                  (just over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand Pigeon.
